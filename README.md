# Cake.SemVer
A set of aliases for http://cakebuild.net to help with Semantic Versioning.


You can easily reference Cake.SemVer directly in your build script via a cake addin:

```csharp
#addin nuget:?package=Cake.SemVer
#addin nuget:?package=semver&version=2.0.4
```

NOTE: It's very important at this point in time to specify the `semver` package *and* the version _2.0.4_ for it.
